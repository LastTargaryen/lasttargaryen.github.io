ALPHA version.

Lemme start with the bad stuff:

*** If you _unselect_ "Rhyme Scheme Setup?" (by clicking it again), any lyrics or scheme letters will be erased from that section--it resets the section entirely, back to the four blank lines.


*** Supports (optional) rhyme schemes for these letters: A B C D E F X ***

    -- Color codes for each of these letters. X will always be black, though, because:
    
        -- Using X is for lines that do not rhyme with any other lines. An X X pair wouldn't rhyme; it'd indicate two non-rhyming lines back-to-back. 
    
        -- No matter how many times or in what order, X indicates an intended departure from rhyme scheme
    
    -- typing any other letter aside from A, B, C, D, E, F, or X will disable the next scheme letter input

-- Aside from that, yeah you can set a rhyme scheme for yourself so it's easier to track what lines must rhyme

-- These embedded points of focus are meant to keep a user grounded in the technical aspect of songbuilding, and thus makes it a bit easier to broaden / artistically             complicate your rhyme schemes in service of expressing oneself better than one could before.

-- Alternatively / additionally, you can change / remove / swap out rhyme scheme letters in single-value input box to the left of every line.


-- Can dynamically add a line directly underneath an existing line by pressing ENTER

-- using SHIFT from within a lyric line jumps the cursor to the _next lyric line_.

--supports using parentheses as part of lyrics

-- using "Copy To Clipboard" and / or "Export to PDF" formats your TITLE (if any) and sections with their structure labels (or lacktherof). Both title and Structure labels (if either exist) are conviniently placed in brackets.


Example of formatting for both PDF generation clip-board copy:

[Title: What I Found In Music]
[Intro]
Here I go, singing my song
highly doubt that I'll do it wrong
I do it now, whilst in this thong
after beating you at ping pong
[Verse 1]
Helping apples do their thing
a nobel action, yes indeed
is what I'd like so much to sing
out of the way, if you please
```
